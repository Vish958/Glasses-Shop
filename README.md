# Glasses-Shop

This time job is to scrape all the available glasses from this website 

'https://www.glassesshop.com/bestsellers'.

We're interested in getting the 'product url', 'product image link', 'product name' and the 'product price'.

Please note, at the bottom we do have the pagination so make sure to handle that too.

Finally, make sure to generate a dataset from all the scraped glasses, you can either generate a JSON file or a XML file.

# I attached the sample of the output where you find the result.

# Make sure you don't confuse on the name of the project and Spider it's really annoying.

# THANK YOU
